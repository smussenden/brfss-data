# About the Data

The data for this project is way too big to store on git. [Download it](https://www.kaggle.com/cdc/behavioral-risk-factor-surveillance-system/downloads/behavioral-risk-factor-surveillance-system.zip) and unpack into this folder here in order for script to work. The gitignore prevents you from comiting the csvs.
